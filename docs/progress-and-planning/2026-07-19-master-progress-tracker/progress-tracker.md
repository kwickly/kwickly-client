## Known Bugs / Tech Debt

| # | Severity | Repo | Description | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 🔴 High | kwickly-client | `checkout/page.tsx` hardcodes `tableNumber: 'Table 12'` for every order | 🔴 Fix in Phase 9 |
| 2 | 🔴 High | kwickly-api | `updateOrderItems()` is destructive (DELETE + INSERT). Must become append-only | 🔴 Fix in Phase 9 |
| 3 | 🟡 Medium | kwickly-api | Every public order creates a new `orders` row. No session concept for dine-in | 🔴 Fix in Phase 9 |
| 4 | 🟡 Medium | kwickly-admin-web | `CreateMenuItemSheet.tsx` has Resolver type mismatch (pre-existing) | ⏸️ Deferred |
| 5 | 🟡 Medium | kwickly-admin-web | `PlatformTenants.tsx` plan enum mismatch (BASIC/CUSTOM not in type) | ⏸️ Deferred |
| 6 | 🟢 Low | kwickly-api | `POST /public/:slug` resolves `branchId='default'` but doesn't validate mode | 🔴 Fix in Phase 9 |
